Feel free to asked me anything to clarify what to do. Here is my plan:
I am building a web application whose MAIN GOAL is:
👉 Learning English by memorizing and mastering vocabulary from films and TV series.

This is NOT just a video player project.
The core of the app is SUBTITLES → WORD ANALYSIS → VOCABULARY LEARNING → PROGRESS TRACKING.

--------------------------------------------------
MAIN GOAL (VERY IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------------------------

My primary goal is to learn English vocabulary effectively.

The learning flow is:

1. I (as ADMIN) upload a subtitle file for a movie or TV episode.
2. The website processes the subtitle file.
3. The system extracts ALL words.
4. The system:
   - Categorizes words by PART OF SPEECH (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction, phrase etc.)
   - Finds the BEST CONTEXTUAL MEANING related to the film
   - Translates meanings into BANGLA (Bangladesh context)
5. Users learn words film-by-film or series-by-series.
6. User progress is tracked over time.


--------------------------------------------------
CONTENT STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------

Content hierarchy must be:

- Movies
  - Movie
    - Subtitle file (only for admin user)
    - Vocabulary list (derived from subtitle)

- Series
  - Series
    - Season
      - Episode
        - Subtitle file (only for admin user)
        - Vocabulary list

Words must be organized so users can study:
- Movie by movie
- Series by series
- Season by season
- Episode by episode

--------------------------------------------------
WORD PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

For each subtitle file:

- Parse subtitle (prefer `.vtt`, `.txt`, but `.srt` may exist)
- Clean text (remove timestamps, noise)
- Tokenize words
- Normalize (lowercase, base form / lemma)
- Remove duplicates
- Identify:
  - Part of speech (POS tagging)
  - Contextual meaning (based on sentence usage)
- Map best BANGLA meaning (not dictionary dump, but context-aware)

Words should be stored with:
- Original word
- Base form
- Part of speech
- Example sentence (from subtitle)
- Bangla meaning
- Source (movie/series/season/episode)

--------------------------------------------------
USER LEARNING & PROGRESS TRACKING
--------------------------------------------------

The system must track per user:
- Which words they have seen
- Which words they marked as learned
- Which words they revised
- Learning progress per:
  - Movie
  - Series
  - Season
  - Episode

The UI will later show:
- New words
- Learned words
- Weak words
- Progress percentage

--------------------------------------------------
TECH STACK
--------------------------------------------------

- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- Cloudflare Workers / Pages (NOT Vercel)
- Wrangler
- No Node-only APIs (Cloudflare-compatible only)



--------------------------------------------------
WHAT I NEED FROM CODEX
--------------------------------------------------

1. Previous code was broken, unable to run (it was writen by Codex), so fix it

ASSUME:
- Vocabulary learning is the CORE feature
- Everything else supports this goal
- Solutions should be SIMPLE, CORRECT, and FUTURE-PROOF
- UI could be simple, modern, and beautiful
